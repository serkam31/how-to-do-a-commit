A commit is a way to save your work in Git.
It records the changes you made in your project with a short message that explains what you did.
Each commit helps you keep track of progress and makes it easy to go back if something goes wrong.

Check what changed: git status

Add the files you want to save: git add "name_of_the_file"

Create the commit with a message:
git commit -m "__"

Writing a Good Commit Message:
-Start with Feat, Fix, Update, Remove
-Describe what he did keep it short and clear 
exemple: git commit -m "feat: 

To see your commit history: git log 

A commit is like a save point in your project.
Make commits often!!!
